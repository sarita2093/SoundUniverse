## SoundUniverse
Keeping up with my attemt to make art using code. This makes beautiful bubble visualization based on music. 
I followed [this tutorial](https://workshops.hackclub.com/sound_galaxy/) from hackclub. 
In the process i also learnt about Fourier transformation and how it is used to filter out different frequencies of sound. This is a good video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY).

Clone this repo and simply serve it with any server. I use http-serve. 

```
npm install http-serve -g
http-serve

You can modify the `Particle.update` function to create your own visualizations.
